Climate Visualizer
==================

This project is about visualizing future temperatures in Europe according to
SMHI. The data is simulated using a climate model and covers the years 2000-2100.

The purpose of this is not to be a scientific source or anything similar. It is
only for entertainment and for people to explore the predicted future climate
changes and see how temperatures changes over time.

If you want to change the dataset you just have to change the temps.txt to an
other file with the same syntax. For details on the syntax see `the file format
information from SMHI <http://www.smhi.se/en/2.575/Climate-scenarios/climate-scenarios-1.6628>`_
and for details about the dataset see `climate scenario data download from SMHI <http://www.smhi.se/en/2.575/Climate-scenarios/climate-scenarios-1.6629>`_

It requires a server with PHP and the PHP extension GD for hosting. The only requirement on the client side is a browser with support for HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.
